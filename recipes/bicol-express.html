	<ul>
		<li>Finger Chilies</li>
		<li>Onion</li>
		<li>Garlic</li>
		<li>Oil</li>
		<li>Thai Chili Peppers</li>
		<li>Coconut Cream</li>
		<li>Coconut Milk</li>

		<li>Salt</li>
		<li>Pepper</li>

		<li>Water</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Steps</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Brown pork. Saute aromatics in oil in a wide pan over medium heat until softened. Add pork and cook until lightly browned. Add shrimp paste and cook for a few minutes.</li>
		<li>Add coconut milk and water. Coconut milk tends to curdle or separate when brought to a boil or heated too quickly. Cook in a gentle simmer to ensure a smooth, creamy sauce.</li>
		<li>Cook pork. Add chili peppers. Cover and simmer until the pork is tender and the liquid is reduced.</li>
		<li>Add finger chilies and coconut cream and continue to simmer until thickened and begins to render fat. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
